### Description

Imagine a digital world where pixels break free, swirling around like a lively
whirlwind. Pixel Plague is all about these vibrant pixels spreading out from different spots,
creating a funky and always changing design. The project was born out of my love for
old-school tech looks, pixel and glitch art, and the fun of randomness. While exploring the
generative art, I aimed to capture those elements. Starting with randomness, initially, I
didn't have a fixed idea for my projectâ€”I just started experimenting, and Pixel Plague
happened. Keeping it simple was my main idea, so I went with basic pixels and a 16-color
palette that reminds you of the iconic Windows 98 era.


Later, I got the idea from remembering broken pixels on some older screens that looked
interesting. I thought, what if these broken pixels acted like a virus, spreading from
random spots? I wanted to turn it into something beautiful. And even though I like
randomness, I decided to add a bit of controlâ€”you can tweak pixel size, spread speed,
and the number of starting points. It's like a dance between chaos and order; you give
some instructions and let the computer do the rest.


I also think there's beauty in growth, especially if it grows in unexpected ways. You don't
know which way the "pixel monster" is going to expand, and you just watch it getting
bigger, taking up more and more space on the black screen, turning it into a pixelated art
piece.
